Chelsea striker Fernando Torres insists he does not feel under any extra pressure at being the most expensive signing in British football.

The Spain international left Liverpool for Chelsea in a record-breaking £50million deal on deadline day during the January transfer window.

Torres has yet to find his best form for Chelsea since his arrival and is still looking for his first goal for the club.

However, Torres says he is not struggling with the burden of expectation and sees his price tag as a compliment and a boost to his confidence.

Asked if being the most expensive signing in the Premier League meant more pressure for him, Torres told Spanish daily AS. "No, not at all. For me, it has been a massive test of confidence.

"The fact that [Chelsea owner, Roman] Abramovich has paid that much money demonstrates that he wants the best team possible - he has ambition and he is not going to give in until he has won the Champions League, which is his dream."

50-50

Chelsea face Premier League rivals Manchester United in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and Torres rates their chances of progressing past their old foes at 50-50.
"I think it [Chelsea's Champions League chances] depends on whether or not we get past Manchester United in the quarter-finals, which is 50-50," added Torres.

Turning his attentions to the other pick of the Champions League quarter-finals and he believes Real Madrid are slight favourites to overcome Tottenham.

"Real Madrid are the favourites to win, although it is not going to be easy," noted Torres.

"That is more 60-40. The Whites are going to have to play really well to beat Tottenham, who have some great players like Modric, Bale and Lennon."

Torres admits he dreams of coming up against a Spanish side in the final of the Champions League for Chelsea.

"I would love to play in the European Cup final, with Chelsea, against a Spanish side," added Torres.
